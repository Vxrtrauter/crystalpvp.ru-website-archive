<title>konsa claient FREE AND ENHANCED EDITION!!!!!</title>
Konas Client (free & enhanced edition)<br>
<br>
**DOWNLOAD LINK**: https://crystalpvp.ru/konas/package.zip<br>
<br>
[ info ]<br>
Long awaited (not really) free version of Konas Client (https://konasclient.com)<br>
<br>
I don't have anything to tell you besides that this "not-a-hack-but-an-utility-mod" isn't even worth $5<br>
<br>
+ The aimware ripoff (new) GUI looks like shit and works even worse<br>
+ The old GUI looks like moneymod+2 ([pic](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/edb1fdc23188fa30ffeacc353ac688272e6e163476063450fff383172b497b76/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f335877536e55712e706e67))<br>
+ The visuals are just... bad (why did Konas developers remove the old Nametags? they were a lot better)<br>
+ The loader is absolute dogshit as almost half of the time it fails to load the client (fixed in this version LOL)<br>
+ Konas crashes the game in singleplayer (this is **NOT** a problem of this version, Konas also crashes if you use the paid version)<br>
+ Modules are hard to configure (mainly because of the shit GUI's)<br>
+ Also the loader is just a [Raion](https://github.com/Ropro2002/raion-public/tree/main/src/main/java/me/cookiedragon234/falcon) paste LMAOOOO<br>
<br>
So you save $5 and get: a bad client with bad loader and bad security. I don't think that buying Konas is a wise choice...<br>
Refund it if you can.<br>
<br>
[ reasons ]<br>
This time there were actual reasons to make and upload publicly this FREE VERSION of this EPIC CLIENT<br>
<br>
+ For reverse engineering training purposes<br>
+ For the shit modules Konas has to offer, it doesn't cost $15<br>
+ It's bad. You can get something like KAMI Blue/Wurst+2/Wurst+3/Phobos FOR FREE and most modules will work better than this piece of shit (and I'm not joking)<br>
+ ^ just get rusherhack or something<br>
+ My man cattyngmd once have won a Konas giveaway **IN THEIR OFFICIAL DISCORD SERVER**, but Darki decided to scam him, so he banned him and did a reroll ([proof](http://crystalpvp.ru/konas/scam.png))<br>
<br>
[ how-to ]<br>
So how do you install this FREE VERSION of COOL K LOGO CLIENT?<br>
<br>
1. Download package.zip from the releases page<br>
2. Put konsa_new.jar to your .minecraft folder<br>
3. Put konsafree.jar to your .minecraft/mods folder<br>
4. Add -noverify to your minecraft launch parameters (don't know how to do that? Tough luck.)<br>
5. Start the game<br>
<br>
If you somehow fuck up the instructions then a message box will appear telling you exactly what did you fuck up<br>
<br>
[ notes ]<br>
1. As I said, Konas devs somehow fucked up something so the game will crash if you decide to join a singleplayer world<br>
2. Discord RPC doesnt't work if you start the game with it already being enabled (in your config)<br>
3. You **NEED** to add -noverify to your launch parameters, otherwise the game will crash<br>
