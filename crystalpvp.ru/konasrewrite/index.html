<strong>Konas Client 1.0.1 (rewrite) Free Edition<br><br>

<img src="logo.png" alt=""><br><br>

[ info ]<br><br></strong>
When I saw Konas 1.0 I thought that it might actually be good and as a result of 3 months of silence the client might&#39;ve actually become good.
<br><br>
I was quickly disappointed to see that the client actually became worse.
<br><br>
Modules are now even more broken, new GUI styles look very bad, and it looks like 3 months went into making good ESP.
<br><br>
Konas still isn&#39;t worth $15, and you can download <a href="../rusherhack/index.html">RusherHack</a> for free which is still superior compared to this shit client.
<br><br>
<strong>[ how-to ]</strong>
<br><br>
Konas developers somehow made everything worse in the rewrite, not only the client but also security

<ol>
<li>Download konsaloader.jar from <a href="konsaloader.jar">here</a></li>
<li>Put it into your .minecraft/mods folder</li>
<li>Start the game</li>
</ol>
