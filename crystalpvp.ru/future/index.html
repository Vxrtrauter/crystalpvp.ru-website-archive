<strong>[ info ]</strong><br><br>
It&#39;s almost Christmas and Santa came a bit early this year! And so, because you, anarchy players, were behaving very badly this year, you are receiving <strong>COAL</strong> for Christmas. Don&#39;t act surprised, if you still play anarchy 1 year after discovering it, you&#39;re already used to eating shit and receiving shitty presents, aren&#39;t you?<br><br>
Since our first Konas crack people have been asking us to crack Future nonstop, and the reason why we weren&#39;t touching it is because there was no reason to do so.<br><br>
RusherHack has a lot more useful utility mods than Future does and Future loses to 3arthh4ck in PvPs. RusherHack got cracked by us a week after we released the first Konas crack, and 3arthh4ck is free.<br><br>
Not only that, but Future got worse over time. 0x22 started pasting features from 3arthh4ck and just making stuff worse, for example the GUI and HUD look like shit now (<a href="comparison.png">click here for shitty comparison</a>). Then 0x22 got crystalpvp.cc server access and he started making serverside bypasses that only users with Future could do, so if you packetlogged Future&#39;s packetfly and just replaced some values in your packetfly code then your packetfly would magically start working again.
